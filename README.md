This is a semi-satirical, semi-deadly-serious application to drive home
how slow Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination roll-out has been.

It’s written in R using the **shiny** and **shinydashboard** packages
along with the standard **tidyverse** suite.

All data is courtesy of the most-excellent [Covid 19 Tracker
API](https://api.covid19tracker.ca/docs/1.0/overview).
